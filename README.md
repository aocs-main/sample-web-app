# Devops Mini Project Assignment

Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a web application. Use tools like Git and GitLab.

You may use the sample setup [here](https://github.com/aocs-main/devops-in-a-container).

You will need to explain your additional setup that you need to do to for the CI/CD pipeline.

Simulating mini project like a closed environment will be a plus.
